# ReadMore
 ReadMore is an open-source mobile application focused on making book search and download easier. ReadMore comes with Reader included in the application, so you don't have to install anything else.
And the best part is, you get all these things for FREE!

## About
Readmore is built on top of http://gen.lib.rus.ec and it'search. We don't owe any books or files on our servers.   
Our primary goal is to give a free option to read books on phone for all users.  
### How it works
Firstly, when you try to search for a book, we scrap the raw data from http://gen.lib.rus.ec to get all the neccesary data fro displaying books. Then we use scraped Id of books to get details about each of them.  
Books are downloaded to your device internal storage and you can access them only inside application. 
### How do we get the books?
We are not holding any books on our servers, we are just redirecting already made websites for books. We are not responsible for any author rights

 ## Notes
 For now, only pdf files are supported in the search, so there are not all books from websites(epub, mobi..).
